				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h3>Who We Are</h3>
				<p>
				The Arty Bake is a local family-owned and operated bakery specializing in Swiss, French and German baked goods and pastries.

				The bakery has been in the same location in Moore Street for over 100 years. We use fine ingredients and traditional methods to produce ​exceptional breads, artisanal breads, ciabattas,  pan loafs, pastries, gluten free (and other dietary needs) and of course....cookies, cakes and donuts! 
				</p>
				<h3>Our Vision</h3>
				<p>
				While we continually strive for innovation, the same care and attention to detail just like we always have at Arty Bake, we are still making our creations the way our mentors made them, no added preservatives or additives. And they'd be pretty proud of that. Only now, we are in a food truck!
				Hope to see you soon!
